# My_debtors_Team35

## Background ðŸ’¡
The rate at which debt is killing the school business is quite alarming, and most especially the private schools.  A lot of cases have been recorded, whereby a student owes a school and after a while the student disappears to another school, without reconciling his/her debts.

## About the Project ðŸ“–
This is a platform that allows schools in a certain locality to list the directory of people owing them so as to avoid debtors applying to other schools with pending debts. The website will also enable schools to keep the debt summary (amount that has been paid and collected) and track debts of various students and also give the debtors access to challenge information put up by the schools. -Team 36
