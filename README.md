# stuDebt

## Background üí°
The rate at which debt is killing the school business is quite alarming, and most especially the private schools.  A lot of cases have been recorded, whereby a student owes a school and after a while the student disappears to another school, without reconciling his/her debts.

## About the Project üìñ
This stuDebt platform is centred on helping schools prevent debtors from registering in another school despite pending debts in the previous school.<br/>
The platform enables schools to upload names of debtors and also check for the debt record of each student before registering the student. <br>
The stuDebt platform also allows students to challenge every debt that they believe is not consistent with the amount they had paid.
